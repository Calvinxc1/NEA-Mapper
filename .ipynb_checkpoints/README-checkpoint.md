## New Eden Analytics - Mapper

#### Description
This is my own spin on the EVE online [Pathfinder](https://www.pathfinder-w.space) and [Tripwire](https://tripwire.eve-apps.com/) appications. I very much like both apps, but I find that both have functionality that the other is missing, and I want it all! :-) So, I figure as a learning opportunity for me, I'll design my own version of a wormhole mapper app, hence what I have here.

Once it's ready for 'prime time', I'll host it as a portion of the [New Eden Analytics](https://github.com/Calvinxc1/NewEdenAnalytics) website.
